🌈 Luma – Building an Inclusive World for Neurodiverse Minds

Luma aims to break these barriers by leveraging AI-powered, accessibility-focused tools to support neurodivergent users such as autistic, dyslexic, and ADHD individuals.

Our goal is to empower, not “fix”.
To support, not standardize.
To create a world where every mind is honoured. 💛
