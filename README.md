Project for Innoverse 2.0 Hackathon
Building an Inclusive World for Neurodiverse

Overview :

Neurodiverse individuals face significant barriers in society, education, and workplaces due to traditional environments and systems designed for neurotypical functioning. These barriers include lack of understanding, accommodations, and inclusive tools that recognize and leverage diverse cognitive strengths rather than emphasizing deficits. Misconceptions, stigma, and inflexible infrastructures contribute to underemployment, social exclusion, and limited opportunities for neurodivergent people. This project addresses the need for inclusive digital solutions that facilitate accessibility, personalized support, and empowerment for neurodiverse individuals, creating a world where their unique talents and perspectives are valued and integrated.
